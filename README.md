# CAOCAP Ficruty — The Spatial IDE

> *"The most dangerous thought you can have as a creative person is to think you know what you're doing."*
> — Bret Victor, [The Future of Programming](https://youtu.be/8pTEmbeENF4)

**Ficruty is a spatial, agentic code editor built natively for iOS/iPadOS.** It replaces the traditional text-file mental model with an infinite canvas where your software requirements, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and live preview exist as interconnected spatial nodes — all compiling and running in real-time.

## The Mission
**Push the boundaries. Improve the experience.**

I am not here to advocate for a specific niche or a "new way" to program. I am here to relentlessly challenge how software is built. If a boundary exists that limits a developer's creativity, I want to push it. If an experience is broken, I want to fix it.

Ficruty is the pursuit of the ultimate developer experience, by any means necessary.

---

## What It Does

When you create a new project in Ficruty, you don't open a file. You open a **spatial workspace** with five interconnected nodes already wired together:

```
[SRS] ──────────── [HTML] ──── [Live Preview]
                     │
               ┌─────┴─────┐
             [CSS]       [JavaScript]
```

- **SRS Node** — Write your software requirements in a distraction-free Notion-style editor.
- **HTML Node** — Edit full HTML structure with native syntax highlighting and a line-number gutter.
- **CSS Node** — Style your app with real-time syntax highlighting (properties, selectors, values).
- **JavaScript Node** — Add interactivity with keyword, comment, and string highlighting.
- **Live Preview Node** — A 9:16 `WKWebView` that automatically compiles all three code nodes and renders them live. Tap it for a full-screen immersive preview.

**Every time you edit code and tap "Done", the Live Compilation Engine merges your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single document and pushes it to the WebView — automatically.**

---

## The CoCaptain 🧠
Ficruty isn't just spatial; it's **agentic**. The **CoCaptain** is your AI sidekick that understands the entire spatial graph.

- **Context-Aware Intelligence**: CoCaptain reads the SRS requirements, HTML structure, CSS styles and JS logic via the `ProjectContextBuilder` to provide grounded coding assistance.
- **Agentic Control (Vibe Coding)**: Ask CoCaptain to "fix the layout" or "add a dark mode," and it can generate precise `nodeEdits` or trigger `AppActions` (like "Create New Node").
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: All AI-proposed changes are bundled into **Review Items**, allowing you to preview and "Apply" them with a single tap.
- **Firebase AI Logic**: Powered by Google **Gemini 3 Flash** through Firebase AI Logic for low-latency, streaming responses.

---

## The Philosophy
Ficruty is a technical pursuit of the "Forgotten Future" described by **Bret Victor** in [The Future of Programming](https://youtu.be/8pTEmbeENF4). The premise: in 1973, the future of programming was spatial, direct, and immediate. We ended up in a world of text files and compilers instead.

Ficruty is the correction.

## Repository Layout

Ficruty is organized as a public product monorepo.

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ios-app/` | Native iOS/iPadOS app and Xcode project |
| `android-app/` | Reserved for the future Android app |
| `website/` | Reserved for the public website, support pages, and policies |
| Root docs | Product overview, roadmap, architecture, contribution guide, and license |

---

## Getting Started

Ficruty requires **Xcode 15+** and an iOS 17+ simulator or device.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Azzam-Alrashed/CAOCAP-Ficruty.git

# 2. Open in Xcode
open CAOCAP-Ficruty/ios-app/caocap/caocap.xcodeproj

# 3. Select a target and run (Cmd+R)
```

> [!TIP]
> Run on a physical iPhone for the best spatial canvas experience. Pinch-to-zoom feels dramatically better on real hardware.

## Devlog

### 2026-04-24: Agentic Control & Gemini 3 Flash
- **Gemini 3 Flash**: Updated the core LLM to the latest `gemini-3-flash-preview` via Firebase AI Logic, bringing improved reasoning and faster response times.
- **Agentic Control v1**: Scaffolded the `CoCaptainAgentCoordinator` architecture to support autonomous actions and structured node patching.
- **Vibe Coding Workflow**: Implemented **Review Bundles** and `NodePatchEngine` for human-in-the-loop code injection. Ask the AI to modify your CSS or HTML, and apply the diff with one tap.
- **App Action Dispatcher**: Added the `AppActionDispatcher` to allow CoCaptain to navigate the app or create nodes on behalf of the user.

### 2026-04-23: Agentic Intelligence & Firebase
- **CoCaptain v1.0**: Implemented multi-turn chat memory and scroll position persistence for a seamless AI experience.
- **Firebase AI Integration**: Switched to Firebase AI Logic SDK for Gemini-powered responses, enabling real-world agentic capabilities.
- **Secure Authentication**: Integrated Firebase Auth with support for Apple, Google, and GitHub. Added silent anonymous sign-in and account linking UI.
- **UI Polish**: Redesigned the CoCaptain input area with a sleek, auto-growing layout. Switched user message bubbles to a premium monochromatic blue gradient.
- **Interaction Design**: Implemented "Slide-to-Select" radial menu behavior for the `FloatingCommandButton`.

### 2026-04-22: Spatial WebView & Live Coding Engine
- **Live Preview WebView**: Integrated a 9:16 `WKWebView` node as the central rendering target for all spatial code.
- **Multi-Node Linking**: Refactored `SpatialNode` with `connectedNodeIds` for 1-to-N directed graph connections.
- **Native Code Editors**: Built `CodeEditorView` wrapping `UITextView` with a custom regex-based syntax highlighting engine and a synchronized line-number gutter. Zero external dependencies.
- **SRS Zen Mode**: Created a Notion-inspired `SRSEditorView` with serif typography and generous margins.

## Contributing

Ficruty is in active early-stage development ("War Room" mode). I prioritize **architectural stability** and **long-term vision** over rapid feature growth.

- **Discuss First**: For major changes, open an issue to align with the project philosophy before writing code.
- **Standards**: `@Observable` (iOS 17+) for state, `async/await` for concurrency, no blocking `@MainActor` I/O.
- **Clean Docs**: If your change alters the architecture, update [STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide.
